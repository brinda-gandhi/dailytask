In order to determine the lead of the fire to the robot , smoke and fire (thermal) reflections can be clued. The project aims to design a robotic fire extinguishing vehicle that can be operated both wirelessly and manually.
After detecting fire by the sensor the fire fighting robot will automatically turn on the pump in order to extinguish fire catches"

3) Difference between window, screen and document in javascript
window:
Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.

window.screen:
It is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.

window.document:
It is the main object of the potentially visible document object model/DOM.

Since window is the global object, you can reference any properties of it with just the property name - so you do not have to write down window.It will be figured out by the runtime.
